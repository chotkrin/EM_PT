## üî•News

- *2025-02-01*: We have released the UGPhysics dataset and Our Paper on Arxiv.

------


*UGPhysics is a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark tailored for evaluating the physics problem-solving abilities of LLMs across multiple UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) disciplines, comprising 5,520 distinct problems in three main domains, 13 core subjects, and 59 key topics.*

## üèÜ Leaderboard
coming soon!

## ü´µüèª Test your own model

#### Download Data
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/UGPhysics/ugphysics
mv ugphysics/* ./data/
```

#### Export Your Key
```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=your_base_url
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
```

#### Inference

For closed-source LLMs, please replace `${MODEL}` and `${SUBJECT}` by the LLM and subject you want to test.
```bash
python codes/infer_close.py --model ${MODEL} --subject ${SUBJECT}
```

For open-source LLMs, we will use `vllm` to accelerate inference.

```bash
python codes/generate_open.py --model ${MODEL} --system ${SYS_PROMPT} --subject ${SUBJECT} --tensor_parallel_size 8
```
where `SYS_PROMPT` is the system prompt, e.g., "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.".



#### Evaluate
Remember to export your keys as mentioned above. 
```bash
python codes/eval.py --model_path ${MODEL} --subject ${SUBJECT} 
```
